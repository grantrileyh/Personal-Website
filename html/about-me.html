        <h2> In General </h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Civil Engineer from Northeastern University. At school I obtained minors
          in both Computer Science and Mathematics. The classes for my minors
          were the ones I found myself most passionate about, especially Number
          Theory, Algorithms and Data, and Object Oriented Design. Now, a recent
          graduate, I find myself wanting to pursue programming as a career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever I can, I enjoy backpacking, cooking, and playing music. My
          passions lie in creating, meeting people, and being present. My hobbies
          allow me to work hard and improve at something, and have fun while
          doing so.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2> Experience </h2>
        <p>
          As part of Northeastern's Co-op program I worked 3 full time Engineering
          positions at firms around the world. These gave me valuable experience
          meeting non-negotiable deadlines, interacting with clients, and operating
          in a professional work environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked as an Environmental Engineer working with water and sewer mains
          at Environmental Partners in Woburn MA. Working with clients and
          performing surveying at night prepared me for high-intensity workplaces,
          and the engineering firm taught me the importance of doing precise and
          accurate work, and quality control.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my second co-op I traveled to Singapore to do event management
          for the Formula 1 Grand Prix that happens in September. At Faithful+Gould,
          I primarily aided in design and installation of Marquees for vendors
          and entertainers. This was an incredibly deadline driven high intensity
          workplace, and I found value and satisfaction in doing a long day of
          good work.
        </p>
        <p>
          My final co-op I worked as a Structural Engineer at L.A. Fuess Partners
          in Boston. Here, several deadlines were concurrently running, leaving
          employees to work on projects as they saw fit to meet all the deadlines.
          I learned how to effectively balance and complete several tasks, and
          collaborate with my coworkers in the smaller office environment.
        </p>

        <h2> Skills </h2>
        <div class="skills-spread" >

          <p>
            For my computer science minor I primarily worked in Java. I feel
            very comfortable writing code in java, creating tests with existing
            frameworks like JUnit, using standard Object Oriented design patterns
            such as MVC or Client/Server, and using extension, inheritance, and
            composition to create and manipulate classes and data structures.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my personal development I learned Python, and implemented a couple
            short scripts and games. The games I liken to a problem set from
            earlier Computer Science courses, and were built using Pygame to create
            a GUI.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, I created this website from scratch using HTML/CSS and a little
            bit of JavaScript. Learning these languages was rewarding and interesting,
            as this is the most public my work has been. Further, getting into
            design of the UI, and trying to create a website that follows UX
            principles allowed me to both learn a lot, and throw myself into a
            project.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently learning C with the aid of a textbook. I am hoping
            to gain a further appreciation, and rock solid understanding, of what
            higher level coding languages are doing under the hood by implementing
            data structures and past projects in C.
