      <h1> Education: Northeastern University </h1>
      <p> I graduated form Northeastern in Spring of 2020.
        There I studied Civil Engineering with a concentration
        in Structural Engineering. I was an active member of the
        American Society of Civil Engineers Northeastern Student Chapter, in addition
        to being admitted to the Civil Engineering Honors Society, Chi Epsilon.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my studies, I found an interest in,
        and recieved minors in, both Computer Science and Mathematics. I found
        the courses for these subjects to be particularly stimulting and rewarding.
        Learning about Cryptography in Number Theory, common design patterns and
        good practice in Object Oriented Design, and dynamic programming algorithms
        in Algorithms and Data were some of my favorite academic moments in school.
